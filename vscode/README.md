# Setup for VSCode

I use VSCode for my choice of IDE. Following are the setups.

## Create a Profile

It is better to create a profile for your specific work in case you are working in different languages.

1. To create a new profile, you can use the File > Preferences (Code > Preferences or Code > Settings on macOS) > Profiles > Create Profile menu item.
2. I chose the DocWriter profile for this repo. But, you can choose whichever you want. DocWriter gives you the setup for the Markdown preview, intellisence, linting etc. which I find quite useful.
3. Export the profile and save it in your local folder, you can use File > Preferences (Code > Preferences or Code > Settings on macOS) > Profiles > Export Profile menu item and then save to local disk. This will automatically switch profile based on your current project's working directory.
